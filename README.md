### Morai 기반 자율주행 차량 SLAM & Navigation pipeline 구축
[Github](https://github.com/AjouInhaTMAH/2025MORAIContest_VEKMUC)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
